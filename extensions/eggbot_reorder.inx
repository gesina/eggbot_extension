 This extension will perform simple optimizations 
 of selected paths. It will try to change the 
 order of plotting so as to reduce the amount
 of "pen-up" travel that occurs between paths.
 
 Solving for optimal plot order is a difficult
 problem, known in computer science as the
 "traveling salesman problem," or just "TSP."  
 
 This routine does not look for the best possible
 solution; that can be slow. Instead it tries a
 few quick methods that often reduce pen-up 
 travel distance (and time) by 30% or more. 

 Please note: This extension is still considered 
 experimental, and is only provided in case you 
 may find it useful. Be sure to save a copy of 
 your document before running this routine.
